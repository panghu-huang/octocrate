  ///
  /// The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
  /// multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
  /// makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
  ///
  /// The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
  /// the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
  /// the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
  /// return a failure response.
  ///
  /// By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
  /// state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
  /// specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
  /// not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
  ///
  /// The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
  /// field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
  ///
  /// The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
  /// be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
  /// application with debugging enabled.
  ///
  /// Merged branch response:
  ///
  /// You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
  /// a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
  /// *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository

  /// the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.
  ///
  /// You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.
  ///
  /// Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:
  ///
  /// `application/zip`
  ///
  /// GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
  /// you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
  ///
  /// When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
  ///

  /// *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"
